# Description

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. My ultimate goal is to build intelligent machines, capable of recreating our visual world. I study machine learning models that can learn to automatically synthesize visual content and virtual worlds by understanding and modeling millions of images and videos.
