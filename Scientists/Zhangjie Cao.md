# Description

My current research interests include robotics, human-robot interaction, machine learning and computer vision. Lately, Iâ€™m working on human-robot interaction and human-modelling. I try to incoorporate domain adaptation within it to adapt human-robot interaction to new environments. Previously, I have been proposing novel problem in deep domain adaptation and developing algorithms and architectures to address them. I have also worked on projects applying domain adaptation to various applications such as hashing and action recognition.
