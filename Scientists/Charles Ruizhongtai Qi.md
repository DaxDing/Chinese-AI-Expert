# Description

My research focuses on deep learning, computer vision and 3D. I have developed novel deep learning architectures for 3D data (point clouds, volumetric grids and multi-view images) that have wide applications in 3D object classification, object part segmentation, semantic scene parsing, scene flow estimation and 3D reconstruction.
