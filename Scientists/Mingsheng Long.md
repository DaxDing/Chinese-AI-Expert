# Description

My research spans machine learning theory, algorithms, and models, with persistent dedication to create stronger learning machines that adapt versatilely to the complex real world. I am actively working on transfer learning and domain adaptation, deep learning and foundation models, scientific learning and world models.  
  
Our Machine Learning Group (THUML) is interested in empowering machine learning for representation, perception, prediction, and decision making with good tradeoff between accuracy, efficiency, generalizability, and transferability. We focus on major science and engineering problems of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including analysis and understanding of big data from IoT, Software, and Sciences.
